This project allows clients to shop for massage services through this e-commerce site. The site allows clients to add these services into a cart and then checkout. The checkout also includes some logic, such as
not allowing clients to procede to checkout without actually having a product in the cart. Employees are able to login via a portal and access/retrieve the customer orders. The employees are able to edit and delete the 
orders, as well as their own employee information. You can access the dashboard with these credentials:

Username: thomas

Password: jill.korn121

The only thing that is not fully functional is being able to insert into the database. Specifically, this occurs during after checkout after the user confirms the purchase. I am able to insert the user's
address, customer,and payment information. However, the products proved to be more difficult since there were multiple being inserted. Overall, everything is functional except for that.
